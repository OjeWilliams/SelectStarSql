1.Modify this query so there are up to two rows per county â€” one counting executions with a last statement and another without.
```
SELECT
  county,
  COUNT(*)
FROM executions
GROUP BY county

###My attempt###
SELECT
  county,
  last_statement IS NOT NULL AS no_statement,
  COUNT(last_statement)
FROM executions
GROUP BY county, no_statement ;

```
